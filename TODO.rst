 GAMEPLAY
 --------
 
-* Create a large cuboid room (say 20x20x20)
-* Position the camera near the ceiling.
-
-* Put player, shape=Cube(1, white), within the room
 * Let player move around with cursor keys. The player (like all things) can
   only come to rest or change direction at integer ordinates, but moves
   smoothly from one location to the next.
